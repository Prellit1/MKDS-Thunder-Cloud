# Mario Kart DS Custom Object - Thunder Cloud
This repository contains the code, the model and texture, and the texture pattern animation files that can be used to add to Mario Kart DS the thunder cloud. This repository does not contain the means to patch code to Mario Kart DS, for that you will need a setup with NCPatcher.

The addition of the thunder cloud in Mario Kart DS requires the removal of an item already present in Mario Kart DS (you replace an item).
