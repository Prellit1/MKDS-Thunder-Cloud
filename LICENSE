daysant license

Revision 3
1. Definitions

    “This license” refers to the daysant license as at its latest revision.
    “Copyright” refers to any laws or provisions that relate to copyright or are copyright-like.
    “You” refers to any party who is a licensee. You may either be an individual or an organization.
    The “author” refers to any party who holds copyright on the work. This includes the original creator and all other contributors.
    The “work” refers to the copyrightable work licensed under this license.
    The “source” refers to the form of the work used to create and modify the work.
    The “product” refers all forms of the work that is not the source.
    To “use” a work means to do anything with the work that, without the grants and permissions of this license, would make you liable for copyright infringement.
    To “modify” a work means to adapt or copy a work, in whole or in part, other than the creation of a verbatim copy.
        The resulting work is the “modified work” based off the earlier work called the “original work”.
    To “distribute” a work means to use the work which makes the product available to any third party. The work can be a modified work or the original work.
    An “attribution method” refers to any one of a hyperlink, button, menu option, or any other mechanism by which parties who use the work can find information that is specified in later provisions.

2. Agreement to this license

    By using, modifying, distributing, or copying this work, you agree to this license in full.
    In the event you take part in any action that contradicts or violates the provisions of this license, it immediately becomes void and you may be liable for copyright infringement.

3. Permissions and conditions

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to the use, modification, distributing, copying, and sub-licensing of the work, subject to the following conditions:

    The author is clearly attributed through an attribution method in the product.
    The original work can be found by an attribution method in the product.
    The source of the work, modified or original, can be found by an attribution method found in the product.
    The work cannot be used, modified, or distributed for any purpose, directly or indirectly, which:
        Violate any provisions of:
            The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
            The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights;
            The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
            The International Labour Organization;
            The General Data Protection Regulation.
        Any purposes that involve offensive applications;
            Defensive applications involve the use of force or violence to actively protect against ongoing attacks to protect life, property, territory. This license does not recognize pre-emptive force to prevent a perceived threat’s actions as legitimate defense.
            Offensive applications involve the use of force or violence in any way that is not solely for the purpose of defense against an ongoing attack. This includes, but is not limited to, pre-emptive strikes, aggression, or any use of force intended to cause harm, damage, or destruction outside of immediate self-defense.
    Any party who modifies, distributes, or copies this work must ensure the work, modified or original, is licensed under this license verbatim.
    This license does not grant trademark rights. Unauthorized use of trademarks will mean that you are liable for trademark infringement.

4. Severability

    If any provision of this license is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under any applicable law or regulation, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability does not effect the validity, legality, or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this license.
    In the event that any provision of this license is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, both you and the author agree to replace such provision with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and effect of the original provision.
    The remaining provisions of this license shall continue to be in full force and effect, and the parties shall continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of this license as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had not been included.

5. Waiver of patent rights

    The author hereby irrevocably waives any and all patent rights they may have over the work or may acquire in the future related to the work. This waiver applies to every use, copying, modification, and distribution of the original work and modified works thereof.
    The author agrees not to assert any patent claims against any person or entity who uses, copies, modifies, or distributes the work work under this license, whether the use is commercial or non-commercial.
    This license does not grant any rights or permissions concerning any third-party patents. It is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that their use of the work does not infringe on any existing patents owned by third parties.
